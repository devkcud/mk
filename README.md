# mk

Simply **m**a**k**e files/folders

## Usage

Prefix with `-` to create a dir instead of a file (can create multiples at once)

```bash
mk -this_create_dir this_create_file
```

## Mod

- folder: 755 `rwxr-xr-x`
- file: 644 `rw-r--r--`

## Limitations

- No support for `*` (selectors)
- No support for `{1..9}` (ranges)

## License
